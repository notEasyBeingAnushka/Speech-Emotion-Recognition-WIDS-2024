# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-WIDS-2024
This project will guide you through building a machine learning model that recognizes emotions from speech audio. Each week introduces new skills and concepts in Python, data processing, and machine learning to build and refine your understanding of audio-based ML applications.


## Week 1: Python Basics, Essential Libraries, and Audio Preprocessing
Get familiar with Python basics and key libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas) essential for data handling and visualization. You’ll also dive into audio preprocessing with Librosa to clean and prepare audio data for machine learning.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Master Python basics and foundational libraries for data science.
2. Understand audio preprocessing techniques, such as noise reduction, normalization, and segmentation, to improve data quality.


## Week 2: Regression and Classification Fundamentals
Explore the fundamentals of supervised learning, starting with regression techniques (linear, logistic, and ridge) and moving into classification algorithms (Naive Bayes and SVM). Implement basic models to solidify your understanding of these methods.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Gain insights into when and why to use regression versus classification.
2. Develop hands-on experience with logistic regression and SVM for classification tasks.


## Week 3: Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
This week introduces the structure and functionality of neural networks and RNNs, focusing on their application to sequential data like audio. You’ll implement these models to grasp their inner workings and suitability for tasks involving time series or sequences.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Build an understanding of neural networks and their variants.
2. Recognize how RNNs leverage sequential data to improve model performance on time-based data like audio.


## Week 4: Model Building with TensorFlow and Keras
Begin constructing a neural network model for emotion recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. Experiment with different model parameters and structures to enhance model performance.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Learn to design and implement neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Understand how to manage model training through techniques like parameter tuning and callbacks.


## Week 5: Model Evaluation and Performance Analysis
Evaluate your model’s performance using metrics like accuracy and a detailed classification report. Analyze these results to identify areas for improvement and understand the model’s strengths and limitations.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Master model evaluation techniques, including interpreting precision, recall, and F1 scores.
2. Gain practical insights into model performance analysis and tuning.


## Overall Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will:

Develop proficiency in Python, data preprocessing, and audio feature extraction.
Gain experience in building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
Deepen your understanding of neural networks and apply them to real-world audio data.
